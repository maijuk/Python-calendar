# Python-calendar
A simple calendar with Python tkinter GUI library

Language: Finnish

I made this program in early 2016 as my first Python course project.
With this program you can store and read notifications.
Starting the program you see the notifications for today. You can
add notifications and remove them.

Known issues and development notes

There is an error with removing a notification which I haven't fixed.
This error wasn't there when I first made this program.
The only fix I have recently made is checking the format for the time 
and the date.
Adding a notification includes the option for an alarm but this has not
yet been implemented in the code. 
The notifications for a certain day are not in order by time but by
adding order.
